# Hi there! <img src="https://media.tenor.com/GVbLnw73qD8AAAAi/dancing-duck-karlo.gif" width="50"/>

Hi, I’m Agustin. I’m an analyst programmer finishing my degree in Computer Engineering. I’m interested in software development and looking for opportunities where I can contribute with my technical skills and work as part of a team.

I enjoy working on practical solutions and improving how things are done. I like learning new tools and approaches, and I value clear communication and good organization when working on projects.
